# DAWG

A Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) is a data structure that is used to store a set of words in a compact and
efficient manner. It is similar to a Trie, which is a tree-like data structure that is used to store a collection of
words. However, a DAWG is a more efficient version of a Trie, because it reduces the amount of memory used by
eliminating duplicate words and sharing common suffixes among words. The DAWG is based on the idea of a directed acyclic
graph, which is a graph that does not have any cycles and has a direction for each edge, each edge is labeled with a
letter
or symbol, and each vertex has at most one outgoing edge for each possible letter or symbol. This structure is
particularly
useful for tasks such as spell-checking, autocompletion, and searching large sets of words.

## GOAL
I'm researching data structures to improve my programming skills

## Installation

- Install Maven

- Run unit tests 
```
mvn test
```
- Run unit tests and performance tests
```
mvn verify
```
